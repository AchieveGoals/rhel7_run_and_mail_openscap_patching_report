Purpose: I wanted to have reference bash commands to obtain latest OpenSCAP from Red Hat, then 
     create HTML report which is then emailed to your admins, etc.
     
     A fictional email will be substituted in this script - please change to your lab's or company's email
     
     Provided AS IS, but with my RHEL subscription, it has worked flawlessly to the extent that Red Hat
     doesn't filter out actual CVE vulnerabilitys that it determines in bugzilla it will not fix. 
     
     This script provides bash commands asuiming you can download:

     Comments welcomed.
